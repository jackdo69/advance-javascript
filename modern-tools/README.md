## the Bundle

With the growth of Javascript programs, many other tools are developed
to help making javascript application faster, cleaner, compatiple with
older version of javascript (since we using ES6/Ecmascript2015 or newer).
All those tools come together as a 'bundle'. We will have a taste of few
popular one in this folder by building a simple NodeJS backend application

### Express

This is a popular framework to create nodejs application

### Babel

This module helps convert newer version of javascript to classic version

### ESLint

This module will help linting our code with some conventions and configs, so our
code are cleaned, less bugs, and looks great

### Mocha & Chai

These are 2 seperate packages but normally go together for testing in javascript

### NYC/Istanbul

This package helps show the code coverage that our tests have on the actual application

### rimraf

This package simply do 'rm -rf' command from node

### nodemon

This package will automatically restart the node server
when there is changes, very useful in development
