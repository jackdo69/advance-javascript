## Patterns

When it comes to a large project with many developers
or simply we just want to make our code more efficient,
clean, easy to maintain, there are patterns that we can apply

Here are NOT all the patterns, but some of the main one
that I see a lot. We looked at

1. Command pattern
2. Mediator pattern
3. Module pattern
4. Observer pattern
5. Proxy pattern
6. Revealing-module pattern
7. Singleton pattern
