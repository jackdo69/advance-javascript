## OOP is fundamental way of programming

In javascript world, even a function inherits the property of
an object, which is the building block of OOP
However, Javascript is prototype-based, which differs from class-based
that we found the Java or C#

## How to use

Go the the index.html file, uncomment each line of the `<script>` tag and see
the result in the browser

## Summary

### In this folder, we look at a few ways to create an object and how to set its properties and methods

1. Class
2. Constructor function
3. Object.create

When it comes to add the properties and methods, either we can put it in the instance itself
or in the prototype, both ways seem to work quite similar, depends on individual preferences

### We look at how prototype-chain works, how we can overwrite them

### Finally we tried to learn about some main concepts of OOP in javascript
