## DOM and Javascript

The DOM is where javascript began its journey into
the programming world,
On the browser, with the help of javascript engine(V8, Spider Monkey ...)
javascript holds all the power to add, remove, change properties,
add animation....
In other words, once the browser generated the the DOM, javascript
can do ANYTHING with it
Nowadays, javascript exist in many other worlds of programming: server,
desktop, machine learning, scripting, embedded...
But it's still worth to revise the knowledge of how Javascript
with fully dominate the world of frontend development.
